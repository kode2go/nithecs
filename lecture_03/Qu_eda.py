Basics Steps for EDA:

Here are the basic steps for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Pandas in Python:

1. Import Pandas library: Start by importing the Pandas library and any other required libraries for data analysis.

2. Load data: Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame using functions like read_csv(), read_excel(), read_sql(), etc.

3. Explore data: Use basic Pandas functions to explore the data like profile or reporting or manually via:

- df.head() to view the first few rows of data
- df.tail() to view the last few rows of data
- df.shape to get the number of rows and columns
- df.info() to get the data types and non-null values of each column
- df.describe() to get summary statistics for each column

4. Clean data: Clean and preprocess the data, including:

- Handling missing or null values
- Removing duplicates
- Handling outliers and anomalies
- Handling categorical variables by encoding them
- Analyze data: Use various Pandas functions to analyze the data, including:

5. Grouping data using groupby()
- Aggregating data using functions like mean(), sum(), max(), etc.
- Sorting data using sort_values()
- Filtering data using conditions and boolean indexing
- Creating new columns and features using Pandas functions

6. Visualize data: Create visualizations to explore and communicate insights from the data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

7. Draw conclusions: Draw insights from the analysis and use the findings to answer questions or solve problems. This may involve repeating some of the previous steps or performing more advanced analysis techniques.

8. These are the basic steps for performing EDA with Pandas. However, EDA can be an iterative and exploratory process, and some of these steps may need to be repeated or adapted depending on the data and the analysis goals.
