Question:
    - webscraping
    - Making mixed plots , like distributions and bar plots in the same figure
    - Extraction of features from different datasets using a unique ID The def functions apply function
    - Data visualisation for high dimensional and multivariate data. 
    - How to display all rows of a DataFrame that has 1000 rows
        -- pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 1000)
        

        -- df_string = df.to_string()

    - Applications of pandas in machine learning if any?
        Some of the key applications of pandas in machine learning include:
            - EDA, preprocessing, data integration, transformation...
        
    - I do a lot of image processing and work with large video files with many frames and usually obtain data from the individual frames and need to save the data from each frame in an efficient way. I'm exploring the use of pandas dataframes. Another method could be to use 3D arrays, but I'm unsure how to approach it. Any advice would be useful.
    -- what kind of data
    -- are you using opencv
    -- create a df with video and image index and store corresponding feature
